# 3D-Scene

//How do I approach designing software?
//What new design skills has your work on the project helped you to craft?
//What design process did you follow for your project work?
//How could tactics from your design approach be applied in future work?

# I approach designing software by looking at the main requirements of the project and create a wireframe/pseudo code of the project. The new design skills that my work on the project is essentially everything to do with 3D graphics. Before this course I haven't had any experience coding 3D assets and I had no experience working with OpenGL. 


//How do I approach developing programs?
//What new development strategies did you use while working on your 3D scene?
//How did iteration factor into your development?
//How has your approach to developing code evolved throughout the milestones, which led you to the projectâ€™s completion?

# The process I followed were to follow the course modules in creating each step of the 3D scene from rendering the object, camera, texture, and lighting. I approached developing programs in a step by step manner, by breaking down a large project or objective into smaller parts and tackling each at a time.

# New development strategies I used while working on my 3D scene was setting up the neccassary libraries and existing formulas into my code instead of trying to create new code from scratch. I learned to set up the IDE so that all of the libraries that are included into the project could be read by the program.

# Iteration factor into each step of the development process because it helped me understand the concepts to a certain degree and allowed me to better visualize my project at small intervals of progression. Though, it took me a lot of time to understand certain concepts, I think breaking down the project into smaller pieces helped with my sense of understanding. Iteration is important in software development to make sure that you are taking your time to develop quality applications and designs for the end user.

//How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?
//How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future educational pathway?
//How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future professional pathway?


# My goal is to be a professional software developer focusing on fullstack web development and mobile development as well as machine learning and computer graphics so computer science is an very important and vital to helping me reach my goals.  I am looking to create new technologies for the world to love and enjoy.

# I think computational graphics and visualizations have given me a better appreciation for graphics and game engines created by other engineers. If I were to get into this field I will definitely need more time to dedicate to learning these skills and concepts.

# Computational graphics and visualizations have given me knowledge of how to work with existing libraries, formulas and code. It has also helped me understand graphics, color, and space. This will help me greatly in my professional aspirations of being a Full-Stack Web Developer and Mobile Developer, as well as machine learning and artificial intelligence.
