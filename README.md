# I approach designing software by looking at the main requirements of the project and create a wireframe/pseudo code of the project. The new design skills that my work on the project is essentially everything to do with 3D graphics. Before this course I haven't had any experience coding 3D assets and I had no experience working with OpenGL. In the past I have played around with 3D art like Blendr, but not actually coding assets.

The process I followed were to follow the course modules in creating each step of the 3D scene from rendering the object, camera, texture, and lighting. I approached developing programs in a step by step manner, by breaking down a large project or objective into smaller parts and tackling each at a time.
